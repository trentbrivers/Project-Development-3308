#### 10/5 RJ's updates:

Built out a high level flow diagram depicting the flow of function calls between the frontend-backend and backend-database. We plan to use this as a baseline for identifying portions of the MVP.
PLan for this coming week is to built out functions for the MVP of displaying a single question block on the frontend and getting the data flow for one block/question/answer correct before scaling
up to multiple questions. Plan is to utilize a dummy question/answer for testing for now while the database is built out and connect later.

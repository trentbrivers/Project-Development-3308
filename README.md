**Day/Time/TimeZone for the scheduled team weekly meeting (30 minutes via Zoom):**
Saturdays, 10:00 AM MT

**Vision statement:** Want a fun way to play a trivia game asynchronously, against your friends? Want to compete against yourself and beat your best score? Come check out our new trivia game platform!

**Motivation:** 
We're a team of developers with diverse backgrounds, skill sets, and learning goals across the software development stack. This project - a Jeopardy-style game - gives us the opportunity to collaborate on something engaging while practicing real-world software development. Its flexible scope allows us to scale based on team progress and explore a variety of tools and techniques without being tied to a specific domain. 

**Specific risks to project completion, possibly including:**
1. Underestimation of the difficulty involved/ability to simplify -> We initially considered an online board game with a more obvious spectrum of prototypes/incremental designs (e.g., tic-tac-toe -> checkers -> chess). A working trivia game may be comparatively all-or-nothing.
2. Unidentified integration challenges specifically
   - User interface interactions
   - Game Flow Logic
   - DB + BE integration
3.  New launguage(s) and working environment for most team members

**All general risks from the directions are also relevant:**
1. No prior experience working with these team members.
2. Potential lack of some needed resources or unfamiliarity with finding or accessing
3. Less provided structure than some previous assignments/coursework

**Additional logistical risks:**
1. Team members fully remote.
2. Distributed across 3 time zones which could complicate coordination. 
3. Still in the forming/storming phases of team development.

**Mitigation Strategy for above risks:**
1. Modular project design: weâ€™ll start with a basic features minimum viable product (few rounds, simple head-to-head, minimal data scraped to create a small database) and scale as we go.
2. Additional time investment: longer, synchronous meetings (1-2h instead of 15 min) during early development for architecting the framework to identify potential integration challenges ahead of time. 
3. Avoid procrastination: start right away with basic features development and system architecting. 
4. Early and prompt communication of issues amongst the group via a group text thread. 
5. Already divided into areas of relative strength to get the first sprint off to a strong start:
    - DB: Rachel, RJ (float)
    - Back-end: Abe, RJ (float)
    - Front-end: Trent, Darvin, Megan
7. Backup time slot for meetings already identified: Friday evenings MT. 
8. Optimized for asynchronous communication: we already have a plan in place to handle schedule conflicts, briefing team members on missed standups as-needed.

**Development method:** Hybrid of Kanban, with scrum-style standups.
- Generally what happens is a group meets together for hours to discuss what are the most important priorities for the customer as well as the company. Technical and personnel requirements are reviewed along with preliminary estimates for time-to-completion and deadlines.
- After the initial planning is done, the team leads meet with developers, stories are fleshed out with a more accurate time assessment, and the sprints start.
- Standups should typically be around 15 minutes long, with any concerns about blocking issues brought up during meetings. In depth discussions about technical issues or implementation should not be discussed during standups, and one-on-one time should normally be scheduled for relevant team members for these scenarios.

- Structure of the weekly meetings
  - 15 Minute scrum-style standup/review of the past week of development
  - Discussion of important priorities and planning for the next week of development. Also includes discussion of technical and personnel requirements and time estimates. 
  - Review of due outs and planned weekly development/tasks

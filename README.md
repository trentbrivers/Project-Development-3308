# Project-Development-3308
A software project developed for CSPB 3308


## Milestone 1: Project Proposal
Due: 10/2/25

Create a GitHub repository with all team members as collaborators
[Make sure to add access for the instructor(s)]

Create a README.md file for the repository and include the following:

**Project title:** "Quiz Game That Is Definitely Not Jeopardy"

**Team # 5**

**Team/Product Name:** Not Applicable

**Team members:** list the name, git username, and email for each member.

- Trent Rivers (trentbrivers, trri1737@colorado.edu
- Megan Yeung (meye7066, meye7066@colorado.edu)

**Day/Time/TimeZone for the scheduled team weekly meeting (30 minutes via Zoom):**
Saturdays, 10:00 AM MT

**Vision statement:** Want a fun way to play a trivia game asynchronously, against your friends? Want to compete against yourself and beat your best score? Come check out our new game platform!

**Motivation:** We’re a team with a diverse set of skills, backgrounds, and goals across the software development stack looking for a way to hone a variety of software development skills without needing to go deep into the weeds of a specific domain and are targeting a project whose scope can be scaled based on group progress. 

**Risks to project completion, possibly including:**
1. Underestimate of the difficulty involved -> More difficult to implement/prototype along the spectrum of board games that we considered (e.g., tic-tac-toe -> checkers -> chess) than we originally expected.
2. Unidentified integration challenges specifically
   - User interface interactions
   - Game Flow Logic
   - DB + BE integration
3.  New launguage(s) and working environment for most team members 

**All risks from the directions are relevant:**
1. No prior experience working with these team members.
2. Potential lack of some needed resources or unfamiliarity with finding or accessing
3. Less provided structure than some previous assignments/coursework

**Additional risks:**
1. Team members fully remote.
2. Distributed across 3 time zones which could complicate coordination. 
3. Still in the forming/storming phases of team development.

**Mitigation Strategy for above risks:**
1. Modular project design we’ll start with a basic features minimum viable product (few rounds, simple head-to-head, minimal data scraped to create a small database) and scale as we go.
2. Time investment early in the development for architecting the framework to identify potential integration challenges ahead of time. 
3. Avoid procrastination: start right away with basic features development and system architecting. 
4. Early and prompt communication of issues amongst the group. 
5. Already divided into areas of relative strength to get the first sprint off to a strong start:
    - DB: Rachel, RJ (float)
    - Back-end: Abe, RJ (float)
    - Front-end: Trent, Darvin, Megan
7. Backup time slot for meetings already identified: Friday evenings MT. 
8. Optimized for asynchronous communication: we already have a plan in place to handle schedule conflicts, briefing team members on missed standups as-needed.

**Development method:** Hybrid of Kanban, with scrum-style standups.
- Generally what happens is a group meets together for hours to discuss what are the most important priorities for the customer as well as the company. Technical and personnel requirements are reviewed along with preliminary estimates for time-to-completion and deadlines.
- After the initial planning is done, the team leads meet with developers, stories are fleshed out with a more accurate time assessment, and the sprints start.
- Standups should typically be around 15 minutes long, with any concerns about blocking issues brought up during meetings. In depth discussions about technical issues or implementation should not be discussed during standups, and one-on-one time should normally be scheduled for relevant team members for these scenarios.

- Structure of the weekly meetings
  - 15 Minute scrum-style standup/review of the past week of development
  - Discussion of important priorities and planning for the next week of development. Also includes discussion of technical and personnel requirements and time estimates. 
  - Review of due outs and planned weekly development/tasks
